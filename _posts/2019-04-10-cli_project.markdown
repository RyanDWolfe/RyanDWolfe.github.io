I am finishing up my first from scratch program (CLI) and I have really enjoyed using all the different peices I have learned all together. I feel like I have crossed an inflection point (many more to come, I'm sure) on my ability and understand of programming which is a great feeling.

I did not anticipate how much refactoring I could do, but it was pretty cool to see the finished product after going through multiple iterations. It is kind of frustrating to purposefully break your program for a large refactor and try to make it work again, but none the less an important part of the process.

I chose to use an API instead of web scraping, so I wanted to highlight a few things I wish I had time to do more of: DOM manipulation, prying, and modules. Other than that, I think I used most of what I have learned so far. I even picked up some new tricks like using a constant for all my strings for code readability and some basic rescues.

I don't know how to write tests yet, but I plan on stress testing my program to make sure it can handle most situations. I think it will be hard when I start writing tests to know how much is overkill. Eitherway, I am glad I am enjoying this and hope to keep up the pace.
