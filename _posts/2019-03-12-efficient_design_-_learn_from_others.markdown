I have always struggled with when to start programming versus thinking about how I want to approach the problem. This applies to plenty of other aspects of life as well.

Am I spending too much time wanting things to be perfect? Could I not just improve upon it later once I have a working product? Is it even worth having the best designed code? It seems to be a fine balance so that you don't have to rewrite your code later, but in the end, I think that is just part of the process.

I currently lean towards getting a structure down and coded. Then think through how I could make it better. I do a lot better seeing all the pieces in my code. I know people that first sketch out their ideas on a notepad or a whiteboard which I think works well to conceptualize it, but for now, seeing each method, class, variable, and etc. helps me through the design process (even if I have already started).

I also think that if you are approaching a complex project, you are doing yourself a disservice by jumping into designing your framework for coding without doing research first. There is wealth of information on the internet, co-workers and the like who have probably already had to deal with a similar problem and have found a really good solution. Why not work off that and potentially improve upon it than reinventing the wheel? It seems like a wasted effort. 

I think a lot of people may have a stigma of copying from our traditional schooling days, but the very books we learn from are put together by this same process and we learn from them by being able to copy their contents. The responsibility we each have is to truly understand what we are working on or solving, so stopping and taking the time to think through why something is a certain way is very important.

If you can explain that to yourself, you understand the material and knowledge you are working off.
