I heard that programming had nothing to do with computers and everything to do with problem solving by writing instructions. This really resonated with me.

I first thought it was trivial to break down methods in lots of smaller methods instead of just getting it all done with one. I then realized and drew the parallel between programming and Excel, which I am very familiar with. I could write a formula all in one cell to solve my problem, but then it would be hard to read, hard for anyone else to understand and even harder to diagnose a problem. Further, I could only use it for its original purpose. 

I learned to start by creating all of the small parts and organizing them so that I could slowly put it all back together in an easily readable way that solved the problem. This way I could then easily change any part of my previously long formula on the fly and see all the parts and where it might fail or break.  Not only that, I could even use parts of the formula for other formulas. Whether it was a variable, a calculation or a rule.

My thought process became even better once I blended this with the concept of writting instructions. It helped me manifest what I wanted my program to do with what I was coding.

Now, when I approach a complex coding assignment, I:

1. Write out in comments what I am trying to do in plain English. 
2. Define the names of my methods for all the things I think my program will need to do.
3. List all the things I might want to store as variables.
4. Use these variable names as arguments for the methods that will most likely need them
5. Finally, code the program.

Using this method of problem solving and instruction writing applies to the real world. You first must define the problem, what tools/options you have and how to execute.

Everything else seems to be nuance to me, whether that be vocabulary, syntax, scope, etc. This process helps me remove the majority of the problems and time wastes I might have and focus on creating a more efficient and flexible program.
