I don't mean coding references. I mean ways to look back at prior things learned. In certain aspects of my life I have built up a tool kit of things, best practices, etc. that I keep with me to apply to any new challenge I encounter. This way, I am not doing everything from scratch each time or having to research for long periods of time. 

I don't know what this will look like for programming yet, but having go to places to look up vocabulary and syntax is a must. I have found myself just searching prior labs on my local enviroment to reference or copy code for new labs. I hope to have a more organized list or library of things I reference most at some point. Maybe like my own internal wiki for coding. Google is great, but the way I internalize it can only be displayed by me which makes me think doing so would not be redundant.
