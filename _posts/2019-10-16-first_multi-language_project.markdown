When I started it was a bit of a jumble of me mixing erb and js. Then I got the hang of it and got better at compartmentalizing. The project really forced me to get better at debugging JS which seems a bit easier now that I can navigate the browser dev tools/console better.

I did not find this project particularly hard, but I did run into several nuances that got me stuck for hours. I look forward to moving away from antiquated jquery.

I need to spend more time on my CSS and I would imagine balancing getting things to work and then look good adds a whole other layer of complexity.
