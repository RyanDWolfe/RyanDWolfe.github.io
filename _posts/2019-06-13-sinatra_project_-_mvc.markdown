I just completed my project and I feel like a real web developer for the first time; minus the ability to host the code on a remote server. I learned how to use git flow and have a fully functioning local website that uses a database, MVC, validations, and CSS.

The great part is I think I can now create other projects from scratch that are actually useful which means I have enough of a baseline to be a developer.

I found getting routes to work in Sinatra very frustrating, but I hear with Rails it is easier. I look forward to getting to more powerful languages, gems and projects.

P.S., CSS is the worst...
