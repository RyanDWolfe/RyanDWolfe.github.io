I just finished my Rails project. I struggled a lot more than I thought I would. I think it was because of there being too many moving peices and I would easily get distracted and not stay on fixing one thing at a time.

I started taking small notes in my code when something jumped out at me and I also created a list of small things to look into or fix. This allowed me to rest assured I would not later forget and still be able to focus on the thing I set out to fix in the first place.

The "rails magic" made it hard to debugg issues, but with practice I know it will be more of a positive than dragging down my coding.

I also ran into a few roadblacks where I got so frustrated I just had to walk away. All the research I did and everything I tried didn't work and I thought I had run out of options. I solved this by stepping back and reevaluating what I was trying to do, if I had issolated a specific issue, I could then iterate over all the possible ways to do it until it worked (while taking note not to get lost on what had already been tried). With bigger issues like using SSL on my local, I chose to abondon it and use another method since it was just taking too long for me to learn how to do it. I hope to learn how to do it later, but it was not worth it for my project.

All in all, this was a huge learning experience and it makes it so much easier for the next project.
