This was by far the hardest project to complete since it took in so many different concepts we learned. Making all of the pieces work together was the biggest challenge and helped me improve my debugging skills by checking what is happening at each stage of a process.

After completing the requirements, I feel confident I can take on similar projects. A stuggle I have is not knowing how to find the correct syntax to complete the task I am attempting. Oftentimes the online examples are basic and don't take into consideration the complexity of my particular task. Overall, I think this will just take experience to navigate.

Moving forward, I plan on adding a lot more functionality on both the back-end and front-end of my project to further prove out my skills. I wanted to add authentication with multi-user support, permissions, more complex views and interactions, and improved CSS.
